# Weather Website Using React
A weather website using React. The website uses OpenWeatherMap for the API requests to get the weather information. The CSS used in this website is tailwind CSS. 

# Working
When the website opens, entier the name of the city you want the weather for. After that, click on the button. This would fetch the temperature, humidity, and weather condition for that city. The icon next to the weather description is animated and performs a little bounce.
